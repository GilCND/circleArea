# circleArea
## This project was developed during my programming course
### Create an objective-c class named Circle with fields named radius, area, and diameter. Define set and get methods for radius. Write a computeArea method that calculates (and stores) a circle's area using the radius (3.14 * r * r). Write a computeDiameter method that calculates (and stores) a circle's diameter using the radius (2*r). Test in a program using the scanf function to get a radius value from the user and using the methods you created to calculate and display the area and diameter of the circle.
